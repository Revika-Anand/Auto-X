# Auto-X
Auto-X is a software designed to ease X-ray workflows.
It takes in the information of the patient and then determines whether the part of the anatomy to be X-rayed is clearly visible or not.
If clearly visible, the coordinates of the required anatomy can be sent to an X-ray machine which can then proceed to take the X-ray.
